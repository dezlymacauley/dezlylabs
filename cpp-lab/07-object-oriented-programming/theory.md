1. Abstraction
You can select which parts of the program logic to expose.
E.g. You have a class with a private method that performs some
internal calculation to give a result to the end user.

So the end user can use some functionality without having to interact with
its inner workings.

2. Encapsulation
Ensuring that certain variables can only be accessed by methods.
E.g. a private variable with a getter or setter function.

3. Inheritance
Allows one class to reuse code written in another class,
to avoid having to rewrite common functionality.

4. Polymorphism

Types of polymorphism:
- Compile-time (Static)
- Run-time (Dynamic)
