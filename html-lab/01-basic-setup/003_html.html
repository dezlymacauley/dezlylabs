<!-- 
  Most HTML elements have and opening tag `<html>`, 
  and a closing tag `</html>`. 
  
  The `html` element represents the root of an HTML document.
  In simple terms, think of it as a container that all other elements will
  be placed inside.

  HTML attributes are settings that are placed inside the opening tag of
  an HTML element, to change the behavior of the HTML element or send some
  information to the browser about the web page.

  The syntax is usually:
  attribute="value"

  `lang="en"` tells the browser that the language of the page is English.
