    This is regular button.
    The reason why you add type button. 
    Is to tell the browser that this is a standalone button that 
    is not part of a form.

    This lesson is focused on using buttons outside of forms.

  <button type="button">Click Me</button>
 
  <!-- 
    The `disabled` attribute is used when you want a button to be visible 
    on a page but you don't want it to be clickable.

  <button type="button" disabled>Visit VIP Area</button>

<!--
  The `a` stands for anchor.

  This is is used to create hyperlinks on your webpage.

  These can be internal links or external links.

  `href` stands for hypertext reference.

  `target="_blank"` This will make the link open in 
  a new tab in the browser when it is clicked. 

  `rel="noopener noreferrer"` This is added for privacy and security reasons. 

  1. It hides the referrer URL so that the new page will not know what page
  the user was on when they clicked on the link.
  2. This prevents the new page from getting access to a JavaScript object
  called `window.opener`. If an external link has been compromised 
  by a hacker, they could use this variable to change your page or steal
  malicious information. Classic XSS (cross-site scripting)
