### Making your video

The section at the bottom is called the timeline. 

This is where you will add what will go into the final video 
that needs to be exported.

Click the video that you have imported and drag it to the timeline.

### Edit clips from the clip monitor area

Move to cursor to the location where you want 
the clip to start and press `i`, the shorcut for `set zone in`

Move the cursor to the locatin where you want the clip to end and press `o`,
the shortcut for `set zone out`

Then you can drag that section of video to the timeline.

Note: Before you drag that section of the video, you can decided whether
you want to bring in the video you can choose whether to add only the video,
or only the sound to the timeline.

If you just drag the part of the clip, 
both video and audio will be brought in.

If you don't see the buttons for audio and video then this just means that
the clip does not have any audio and it is just sound.
