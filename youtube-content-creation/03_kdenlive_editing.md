### Create a directory for your project:

```sh
mkdir -p $HOME/local-storage/youtube-content-creation/first-kdenlive-edit/
```

Add all of the video materials to this directory:

These are things like Graphics, Images, Music, and the Video

### First save the project to:

`local-storage/youtube-content-creation/first-kdenlive-edit`
_______________________________________________________________________________
### projects => project settings

Full HD 1080 => HD 1080p fps
_______________________________________________________________________________
### Import the project files into Kdenlive

There's an area on the top left where it says `Sequences`

Don't click on Sequences, right click on the black area under it.

Then click `Add clip or folder`
_______________________________________________________________________________
### Making your video

The section at the bottom is called the timeline. 

This is where you will add what will go into the final video 
that needs to be exported.

Click the video that you have imported and drag it to the timeline.
_______________________________________________________________________________
### Edit clips from the clip monitor area

Move to cursor to the location where you want 
the clip to start and press `i`, the shorcut for `set zone in`

Move the cursor to the locatin where you want the clip to end and press `o`,
the shortcut for `set zone out`

Then you can drag that section of video to the timeline.

Note: Before you drag that section of the video, you can decided whether
you want to bring in the video you can choose whether to add only the video,
or only the sound to the timeline.

If you just drag the part of the clip, 
both video and audio will be brought in.

If you don't see the buttons for audio and video then this just means that
the clip does not have any audio and it is just sound.

### Adjust the progress bar of the clip

In the timeline area where it shows the length of the edited video,
there is a blue bar. Drag this bar to the end of your last video.

### Fade out Transition for videos

In the timeline area where your video clips are, there should be a red circle
in the top right corner of each clip.
_______________________________________________________________________________
### Adding Images

Go to the area in Kdenlive where you imported your video files 
in the timeline and select your images. 

But this time you have to drag and drop it in a different location. 

So all of the clips are dropped on the `V1` line.

The images need to be dropped on the `V2` line above it.

Then you can apply a fade in transition to the logo.

### How to transform (edit) and image

can just adjust the size and position of the video.
