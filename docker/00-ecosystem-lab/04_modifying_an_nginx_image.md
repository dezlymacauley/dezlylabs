Use the program `httpie` to send a GET request.

```sh
http GET http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

You should get an HTTP response back from the Nginx server.

Nginx is listening on port 80 inside the container.

Docker mapped it to 127.0.0.1:8080 on your host.

### The headers (everything before the HTML)

These are HTTP response headers sent by Nginx:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK â†’ The status line.

200 OK means the request was successful.

Server: nginx/1.27.0 â†’ The server that generated the response (Nginx, version 1.27.0).

Date: Sun, 14 Sep 2025 06:55:29 GMT â†’ When the server created this response.

Content-Type: text/html â†’ The type of data being sent (HTML in this case).

Content-Length: 615 â†’ The size of the body (in bytes).

Last-Modified & ETag â†’ Used for caching (so clients donâ€™t download unchanged files again).

Connection: keep-alive â†’ Tells the client to keep the TCP connection open for future requests.

```
ðŸ”¹ The body (everything after the headers)

Thatâ€™s just a simple HTML file â€” the default Nginx welcome page that ships with the image.

<!DOCTYPE html> â†’ Says the document is HTML5.

<title>Welcome to nginx!</title> â†’ Title shown in the browser tab.

<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1> â†’ Big header text in the page.

<p>â€¦</p> â†’ Some explanatory text, links to Nginx docs, and a thank-you note.

ðŸ‘‰ If you opened http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a browser, youâ€™d see the famous Nginx welcome screen.ðŸ”¹ The body (everything after the headers)

_______________________________________________________________________________

Run the `bash` program from an interactive shell `-it` inside the
nginx container called `web_server`
```sh
docker exec -it web_server bash
```

Your prompt will now look like this. That number is the container id
```
root@47a2ed9530e5:/#
```

_______________________________________________________________________________

You can run `ls` to list the contents of the root directory of the 
docker container.

If you run `pwd` it should return `/` which means root directory.

You are also in the bash shell as a root user so you don't need to use `sudo`,
because you have full access to the container as root.

The reason why `bash` and `ls` work is because the `nginx` image is 
actually built ontop of a docker image.


You can confirm this with this command:
```sh
cat /etc/os-release
```

_______________________________________________________________________________

Update the Debian package manager in the container
```sh
apt-get update
```

To search for a package the `apt-cache search ^name-of-package$`

The `^` at the start and `$` at the end mean exact match
```sh
apt-cache search ^bat$
```

```
apt-cache search ^neovim$
```

I can install neovim by running this command:
```sh
apt-get install neovim bat
```
_______________________________________________________________________________

View the default `index.html` file of Nginx using `bat`

On Debian the package is `bat` however you binary executable is `batcat`
```sh
batcat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```
_______________________________________________________________________________

To edit this file:

```sh
nvim /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```
