# Event Booking REST API Project

### About

A web server that serves data (usually in JSON format) by any client that
needs to use that data.

This will serve and store data.

### End Points

CRUD

#### Create
POST, /events -> Create a new event that people can sign up for. `Authentication Required`
POST, /events/<id> -> Register for specific event by its id `Authentication Required`
POST, /signup -> Create a new user
POST, /login -> Login to a specific user account `User authentication via JWT (JSON Web Tokens)`

When a user logs in, we send back a string that is generated by the server,
in a way that the server can verify if the token is valid. 
Then this token will be used when an request is made to an endpoint 
that requires authentication.

#### READ
GET, /events -> Get a list of events available
GET, /events/<id> -> Get a specific event by its id

#### Update
PUT, /events/<id> -> Update the details of an event `Authentication Required` `Only creator`

#### Delete
DELETE, /events/<id> -> Delete a specific evente by its id `Authentication Required`
DELETE, /events/<id>/register -> Cancel your registration for a specific event `Authentication Required` `Only creator`
by its id

### Reproducabilty

#### go.mod

Tracks which modules your project depends on and their versions.

Ensures that anyone else who clones your repo can install the exact same 
dependencies with:

```sh
go mod tidy
go build
```

#### go.sum

Contains cryptographic checksums for every module version listed in go.mod.

Verifies that the modules havenâ€™t been tampered with.

Also ensures reproducible builds.
