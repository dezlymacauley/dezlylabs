What are closures in Rust?

These are annoymous functions that you can save in a variable or pass
as arguements to other functions.

You can create the closure in one place and then call the closure 
elsewhere to evaluate it in a different context.

Unlike functions, closures can capture values from the scope in which they
are defined.

Closures can use variables from the scope that they are defined in.

closures in Rust are similar to lamdbas in other programming langauges.
