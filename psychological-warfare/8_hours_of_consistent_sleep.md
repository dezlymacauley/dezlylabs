# 8 Hours Of Consistent Sleep
_______________________________________________________________________________
## Sleep

Ensure that 8 hours of each day are dedicated to sleep.

#### For clarity:

- This is not meant to be some short 1 week YouTube challenge. 

You must take this seriously as cognitive focus and physical health is the 
foundation for the momentum needed to transform your life, 
and most importantly, the emotional resiliance to stay on track as 
insecure naysayers, low IQ bufoons and other toxic "people" 
with a `crabs in a bucket` mentality try to break your focus, 
fill your mind with the negativity, 
try to get you to change course to whatever nonsense they are choose to waste
their time on, or the deadliest trap of all... 
trying to get you to `take it easy` so that you can fall back into the same
bad habbits make it harder to do the things you know you should be doing.

Pick a realistic 8 hour block that you can maintain for at least a quarter
of the year (3 consecutive months).

- The start time is when you start trying to fall asleep.

- No overnight sessions, regardless of whether it is for work or leisure.
This means that the latest time you should start sleeping is `00:00 AM`,
and the latest time that you should wake up is `08:00 AM`

- Instead of burning the midnight oil, wake up well rested, 
ambush the day, and invest in yourself.

- Productivity should not come at the cost of physical fitness, 
and long-term cognitive focus.

- Cut out anyone from your life who interferes with this pattern, 
or lacks the same burning desire as you.

This is `psychological warefare`, you have to choose between them or 
the epic life you envision for yourself.
