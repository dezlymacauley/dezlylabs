ABOUT: println

This is for simple debugging.
It only works with basic variable types:

boolean, integer, floating point, string, pointer types, complex number types

You can't use println to print:
Slices, arrays, structs, maps, interfaces, channels, functions

package main

func main() {

	println("Hello world")
	// Hello world
    
}
